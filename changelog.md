# Diet App
## changelog
### v1.0.0

#### functionalities

+ Under the package `com.example.dietapp.util.components`, I customize some Android Compose components into class. Including
  - AlertDialog
  - DropdownMenu
  - DatePicker
  - TimePicker
  
+ Under the package `com.example.dietapp.util.queryhandling`, it is easily to dynamically generate some basic MySQL statements.

Additionally, I think it is flexible to use, maintenable (i.e. easier to modify the code once the feature changes), and extensible (i.e. easier to extend the functionalities with fewer code)

+ Under the package `com.example.dietapp.extension.string`, I create some extension function for String type in Kotlin.
